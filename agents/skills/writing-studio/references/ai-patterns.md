# AI Patterns to Avoid

LLMs drift toward a recognizable register: puffed-up vocabulary, decorative symmetry, hedged non-claims, and uniform rhythm. No single instance is "wrong", but they accumulate into prose that reads as machine-written, and readers now spot it and trust it less. Suppress these when drafting; flag them once (as a pattern) when reviewing. This file is the catalog of specific tells; the universal rules own the underlying principles.

## 1. Puffery and filler vocabulary

Words that signal importance, depth, or motion without adding any. Cut, or replace with the concrete thing.

- *crucial, vital, pivotal, essential, paramount, key (as adjective)*
- *testament to, hallmark of, cornerstone of, embodiment of*
- *transformative, revolutionary, game-changing, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, world-class, best-in-class, seamless, robust*
- *leverage (verb), harness, unlock, foster, empower, navigate (the complexities of)* — when not literal
- *delve, dive deep, deep dive, multifaceted, holistic, comprehensive*
- *realm, landscape, ecosystem, tapestry, mosaic, journey*
- *moreover, furthermore, additionally* stacked as paragraph glue

**Test:** remove the word. If the sentence loses only volume, not meaning, leave it out. One or two across a page is fine; a cluster is the tell.

## 2. Empty `-ing` tails

Participial clauses bolted on to sound like more is happening: *..., ensuring reliability across the platform. / ..., highlighting the importance of collaboration. / ..., demonstrating our commitment to excellence.*

**Test:** delete the clause. If no factual content is lost, drop it; if it has real content, make it its own sentence.

## 3. Em-dash overuse and decorative punctuation

LLMs reach for the em-dash constantly, and a document peppered with them is a strong tell (the user also prefers to avoid them). Use a comma, brackets, a colon, or a full stop; keep em-dashes rare and deliberate. Same caution for over-eager semicolons and the "X — and that's a good thing" flourish.

## 4. Rule-of-three padding and false symmetry

The reflexive triad ("clear, concise, and compelling") and balanced-but-empty parallelism. Use three items only when there are genuinely three; vary list lengths.

## 5. "Not only X, but also Y" / "It's not just A, it's B"

The escalation cliché. State the point directly: "It's not just a tool, it's a platform" → say what it is.

## 6. Hedge-and-throat-clearing openers

*It's worth noting that ..., It's important to remember ..., In today's fast-paced world ..., In an ever-evolving landscape ...*, and reflexive closers *In conclusion, ..., Ultimately, ..., At the end of the day, ...*. Delete them and start with the actual content.

## 7. Uniform rhythm and structure

Every paragraph the same length, every sentence ~20 words, every section opening "First, ... Second, ...". Human writing varies: mix short punchy sentences with longer ones, and let some paragraphs run two sentences and others six. (Reinforces A6.)

## 8. Summary that summarizes nothing

A closing paragraph that restates the opening without adding a takeaway, decision, action, or implication. If the conclusion carries no new information, cut it.

## 9. Decorative formatting

Bolding half a sentence, an emoji on every heading, formatting used to decorate rather than aid scanning. Use structure only where it earns its place. (For bullets-vs-prose, see A14.)

## 10. Significance assertions standing in for content

A claim about how important something is, offered instead of the thing itself. This is the phrasal cousin of the puffery in #1: rather than the adjective *crucial*, a whole clause asserting rank. It reads as insight and carries none, and it is the hardest tell to catch because it sounds like a confident writer landing a point.

- *the X that matters, the real question, the real problem, this is the crux, the key insight is, that's what decides it, here's the thing, make no mistake, this is where it breaks down*
- Bolded or headed leads that only announce the sentence after them: "**The credibility risk is the one that matters.**" followed by the sentence that actually explains why.
- Titles and section headings that gesture at a topic instead of stating the finding: "What this means in practice", "Rethinking our approach", "The path forward".

**Test:** cover the sentence that follows. If the lead still carries information, keep it. If not, delete it and promote the next sentence, or compress the claim into the lead: "Self-declared RtB splits are gameable and nobody audits them."

Ranking is legitimate when the basis is stated. "This is the only one of the three risks with no mitigation in the plan" is a claim and can be argued with. "This is the risk that matters" is neither.

## 11. Telegraphic compression

The over-correction of patterns 1 to 10: prose cut until it reads as the writer's notes. Signs: a bare label and colon opening a sentence ("Tests and context: ..."), stacked noun phrases, dropped subjects and verbs, "X: Y; Z: W" runs inside a paragraph, and a conclusion stated without the step that leads to it. It appears most when the writer is asked for "short" and when the writer has just done research the reader has not seen, so their own summary reads as complete to them.

**Test:** the reader-walk (SKILL.md Step 4). Could a colleague who was not in the research restate the sentence without opening a link? If not, write it as a sentence with a subject, a verb and the reason. To make a piece shorter, drop whole points; keep each surviving point in full sentences.

**The overarching test:** read the draft aloud in your head. If it sounds like a confident person explaining something to a colleague, good. If it sounds like a brochure or a committee-written press release, find the patterns above and cut them.
